# Machine Learning - Assignment 2

## Files present  

- `src` directory:  
    - `train.csv` - Contains the data file for training and testing the Naive Bayes Classifier.
    - `requirements.txt` - Contains all the necessary dependencies with their versions.
    - `data_processing.py` - Contains necessary functions to process the raw textual data into tokenized words and create the binary feature matrix.
    - `naive_bayes.py` - Contains the model for the Naive Bayes Classifier.
    - `metrics.py` - Contains the functions to evaluate the performance of the model.
    - `main.py` - Main file for completing all tasks required.

- `output.txt` - The output for a run of the Naive Bayes Classifier.
- `ML_Assn_2_Report.pdf` - A report containing the step-wise description of the implementation and analysis of results.
- `README.md` - A README file describing the files present and the instructions to execute the code.


## Instructions to execute the code

- Navigate to the `src` directory.
- Ensure you are using a latest version of Python3, and install all dependencies.  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
